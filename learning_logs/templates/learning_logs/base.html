<!-- This parent template file contains elements common to all pages. Every other template inherits from 'base.html' -->
<!-- TIP: It is common for template files to have more levels of nesting, so only 2 spaces is enough for indentation. -->

  <!-- the template tag included in href is updated by Django automatically when urls.py is changed -->
  <a href="{% url 'index' %}">Learning Log</a> -
