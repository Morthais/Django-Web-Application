# Summary
SPEC.md details project goals, describes project functionality, and discusses appearance and user interface. Like any good project or plan, a spec should keep you focused and help keep your project on track. This is not a full project spec, but lays out a few clear goals to keep the development process focused. Here is the spec I will use:

* I will write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics they're interested in and to make journal entries as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page should describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries. When you learn about a topic, keeping a journal of what you've learned can be helpful in tracking and revisiting information. A good app makes this process efficient.
